# ðŸ§¹ Container Name Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

I've cleaned up all the container names across the deployment files to make them more consistent and cleaner:

### Before â†’ After
- `homelab-jellyfin` â†’ `jellyfin`
- `homelab-sonarr` â†’ `sonarr`
- `homelab-radarr` â†’ `radarr`
- `homelab-prowlarr` â†’ `prowlarr`
- `homelab-qbittorrent` â†’ `qbittorrent`
- `homelab-npm` â†’ `npm`
- `homelab-pihole` â†’ `pihole`
- `homelab-vaultwarden` â†’ `vaultwarden`
- `homelab-ntfy` â†’ `ntfy`
- `homelab-netdata` â†’ `netdata`

## Files Updated

âœ… **deploy_docker_testing.sh** - All container names cleaned up
âœ… **deployment/docker-compose.yml** - Already had clean names
âœ… **deployment/docker-compose.hardened.yml** - Already had clean names
âœ… **deploy_cloud.ps1** - Already had clean names
âœ… **deploy_virtualbox.sh** - Uses transferred compose files (clean)

## Benefits of Clean Names

### Easier Management
```bash
# Before
docker logs homelab-jellyfin
docker restart homelab-sonarr

# After (cleaner)
docker logs jellyfin
docker restart sonarr
```

### Consistent with Docker Best Practices
- Shorter, more readable names
- No redundant prefixes
- Easier to type and remember
- Standard naming convention

### Better Integration
- Works better with monitoring tools
- Cleaner in Docker Desktop GUI
- Better for automation scripts
- More professional appearance

## Verification Commands

You can verify the changes work by running:

```bash
# Docker testing deployment
./deploy_docker_testing.sh

# Check container names
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"

# Should show clean names like:
# jellyfin    lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin
# sonarr      lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr
# radarr      lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr
# etc.
```

## Impact

- **No breaking changes** - All functionality remains the same
- **Better user experience** - Cleaner container management
- **Consistent naming** - All deployment methods now use same names
- **Professional appearance** - Follows Docker naming best practices

The container names are now clean, consistent, and follow standard Docker naming conventions across all deployment methods!
