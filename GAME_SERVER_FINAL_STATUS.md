## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: One-Click Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run standalone deployer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J35867U/homelab-deployment/main/game-server-deployment/scripts/standalone-deploy.sh
chmod +x standalone-deploy.sh
sudo ./standalone-deploy.sh

# After installation, use unified command:
game-server status      # Check system health
game-server monitor     # Run monitoring dashboard  
game-server backup      # Create backups
game-server web         # Start web interface (http://server:8080)
```

### Option 2: Manual Tool Installation
```bash
# Clone or download individual scripts from:
# homelab-deployment/game-server-deployment/scripts/

# Make executable and run individually:
chmod +x *.sh
./monitoring.sh         # System monitoring
./backup.sh daily       # Create daily backup
node enhanced-web.js    # Start web interface
./status.sh             # Check system status
```

### Option 3: Integration with Existing Game Server
```bash
# If you already have the main game server running:
# 1. Copy management scripts to your server
# 2. Configure environment variables (NTFY, GPG, etc.)
# 3. Run tools individually or install via standalone deployer
# 4. Integrate with existing monitoring and backup infrastructure
```
