## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ❌ **Before (BROKEN)**
```yaml
# downloads/docker-compose.yml - BROKEN
networks:
  homelab:
    external: true      # ❌ Network doesn't exist as external
depends_on:
  - gluetun            # ❌ Gluetun not in same compose file
gluetun:
  external: true       # ❌ Invalid syntax
```

### ✅ **After (WORKING)**
```yaml
# downloads/docker-compose.yml - FIXED
# Uses network_mode: "service:gluetun" approach
# No invalid external references
# Clear dependency documentation
```

## 🗑️ Files Cleaned Up

### **📄 Archived Documentation (33 files)**
- All redundant deployment guides
- Outdated analysis reports  
- Conflicting setup instructions
- Legacy status documents

### **🔧 Archived Scripts (24 files)**
- Multiple conflicting deployment approaches
- Legacy validation scripts
- Old fix/enhancement scripts
- Redundant stage-based deployment

### **🎯 Kept Essential Files**

- `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Single authoritative guide
- `lxc/` - Proxmox configs (if needed)
- `deployment/` - Legacy approach (still works)

## 🚀 Repository Now Ready

# 3. Deploy everything
./deploy-all.sh
```
