Your homelab repository is now **FULLY UPDATED** with comprehensive security hardening implementations. All critical vulnerabilities from the professional security assessment have been systematically addressed.

## üì¶ WHAT'S NEW IN THIS UPDATE

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening Files Added:
- **`deployment/docker-compose.hardened.yml`** - Security-first container orchestration
- **`scripts/security_scan.sh`** - Automated Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **`scripts/firewall_hardening.sh`** - Network security with deny-by-default rules
- **`scripts/dns_hardening.sh`** - DNS security with DNSSEC and malware blocking
- **`scripts/log_monitoring_setup.sh`** - Centralized logging and monitoring
- **`scripts/secret_management.sh`** - Encrypted credential management system
- **`scripts/security_validation.sh`** - Comprehensive deployment validation
- **`homelab_deployment_bug_scan.txt`** - Security analysis reference document

### üîí Security Improvements Implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Container Security**: Non-root users, capability drops, read-only containers
- ‚úÖ **Network Protection**: iptables firewall rules with fail2ban intrusion detection
- ‚úÖ **DNS Security**: Secure upstream servers, DNSSEC validation, malware blocking
- ‚úÖ **Credential Security**: AES256 encrypted secrets, no hardcoded passwords
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Centralized logging with security alerts and dashboards
- ‚úÖ **Vulnerability Management**: Automated Trivy scanning with threshold alerts

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Prepare Proxmox Host
```bash
# Clone/pull latest repository
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/J358763H/homelab.git
# OR if already exists:
cd /opt/homelab && git pull

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Step 2: Execute Security Hardening (In Order)
```bash
# 1. Deploy encrypted secret management
./scripts/secret_management.sh deploy

# 2. Apply network firewall hardening
./scripts/firewall_hardening.sh

# 3. Configure DNS security for Pi-hole
./scripts/dns_hardening.sh

# 4. Setup centralized logging and monitoring
./scripts/log_monitoring_setup.sh

# 5. Run initial vulnerability scan
./scripts/security_scan.sh
```

### Step 3: Deploy Hardened Containers
```bash
# Transfer hardened Docker Compose to Docker host (192.168.1.100)
scp deployment/docker-compose.hardened.yml root@192.168.1.100:/opt/homelab/

# On Docker host, deploy with hardened configuration:
ssh root@192.168.1.100
cd /opt/homelab
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hardened.yml up -d
```

### Step 4: Final Validation
```bash
# Back on Proxmox host, run comprehensive validation
./scripts/security_validation.sh validate

# Check deployment readiness report
cat /opt/homelab/security_validation_report.txt
```
