# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy files that were part of the previous homelab structure but are no longer needed for the current simplified approach.

## Contents

- `legacy-docs/` - Outdated documentation files from previous iterations
- `legacy-scripts/` - Old deployment and utility scripts superseded by the new `setup/` directory

## Why These Files Were Archived

The homelab repository was reorganized on October 16, 2025 to provide a simpler, more maintainable structure focused on:

- Manual control over service deployment
- Clear separation of service groups (core, downloads, media)
- Simple deployment scripts
- Streamlined documentation

These archived files represented an overly complex automation approach that was difficult to maintain and understand.

## If You Need These Files

These files are preserved in case any specific functionality is needed. However, the new structure in `containers/` and `setup/` is recommended for all deployments.
