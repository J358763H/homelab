## Quick Start

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
# If you have access to the deployment structure
git clone <this-deployment-repo>
cd game-server-deployment

# Or download individual scripts as needed
```

### 2. Quick Deployment
```bash
# Run the standalone deployer for complete setup
sudo ./scripts/standalone-deploy.sh

# This installs all tools and creates the 'game-server' command
```

### 3. Manual Installation
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Test individual components
./scripts/status.sh
./scripts/monitoring.sh
./scripts/backup.sh daily
```

### 4. Integration with Existing Game Server
If you already have a game server running:
```bash
# Copy scripts to your server
scp scripts/*.sh gameserver:/opt/game-server-tools/

# Run monitoring
./scripts/monitoring.sh

# Setup automated backups
./scripts/backup.sh daily
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# NTFY Notifications (recommended for alerts)
export NTFY_SERVER="https://ntfy.sh"
export NTFY_TOPIC_GAMESERVER="your-game-server-topic"

# Game Server Paths
export ROMS_PATH="/opt/coinops/roms"
export SAVES_PATH="/opt/coinops/saves"
export CONFIG_PATH="/home/gameuser/.config"

# Web Interface
export COINOPS_PORT="8080"
export MOONLIGHT_PORT="47984"

# Backup Configuration
export BACKUP_DIR="/data/backups/game-server"
export ENCRYPT_BACKUPS="true"
export GPG_RECIPIENT="your-email@domain.com"
```

### NTFY Notifications Setup
```bash
# 1. Choose a unique topic name
export NTFY_TOPIC_GAMESERVER="gameserver-$(hostname)-$(date +%s)"

# 2. Test notifications
curl -d "Test notification from game server" https://ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC_GAMESERVER

# 3. Subscribe on your phone/desktop
# Install NTFY app and subscribe to your topic
```

## Service Integration

### Systemd Services (Created by standalone deployer)
```bash
# Web interface service
systemctl enable --now game-server-web
systemctl status game-server-web

# Monitoring timer (every 15 minutes)
systemctl enable --now game-server-monitor.timer
systemctl list-timers game-server-*

# Check logs
journalctl -u game-server-web -f
```

### Cron Jobs (Automated backups)
```bash
# Daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /opt/game-server-tools/scripts/backup.sh daily

# Weekly backup on Sunday at 3 AM  
0 3 * * 0 /opt/game-server-tools/scripts/backup.sh weekly

# Monthly backup on 1st at 4 AM
0 4 1 * * /opt/game-server-tools/scripts/backup.sh monthly
```

## Usage Examples

### Daily Operations
```bash
# Check overall system status
game-server status

# Run monitoring dashboard
game-server monitor

# Create manual backup
game-server backup daily

# Start web interface
game-server web
```

### Monitoring and Alerts
```bash
# Quick system check
./scripts/monitoring.sh quick

# Full monitoring with all metrics
./scripts/monitoring.sh

# Service-specific checks
./scripts/monitoring.sh services

# Performance monitoring
./scripts/monitoring.sh performance
```

### Backup Management
```bash
# Different backup types
./scripts/backup.sh daily
./scripts/backup.sh weekly  
./scripts/backup.sh monthly

# Check backup status
./scripts/backup.sh status

# Cleanup old backups
./scripts/backup.sh cleanup
```

### Documentation Archiving
```bash
# Archive repository and system info
./scripts/docs-archiver.sh

# Archives are saved to: /data/backups/game-server-docs/
# Includes: repo content, configs, system info, logs
```

## Integration with Homelab Infrastructure

### Monitoring Integration
- **Prometheus**: Enhanced web interface provides `/metrics` endpoint
- **Grafana**: Dashboard templates available for visualization
- **NTFY**: Unified notification system with homelab alerts

### Backup Integration
- **Retention Policies**: Align with homelab backup strategies
- **Storage**: Can use same backup infrastructure as homelab
- **Encryption**: GPG encryption compatible with homelab security

### Network Integration
- **Tailscale**: Compatible with homelab VPN setup
- **Firewall**: Uses UFW like other homelab services
- **Ports**: Documented port usage for network management

## Security Considerations

### Backup Security
- ROMs and save games are encrypted using GPG
- Backup archives use strong compression and encryption
- Retention policies prevent unlimited storage growth

### Network Security  
- Firewall configuration for required ports only
- Integration with Tailscale for secure remote access
- Web interface includes basic authentication options

### Access Control
- Dedicated `gameuser` account for service isolation
- Proper file permissions and directory structure
- Systemd service security with user/group isolation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services not starting:**
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status sunshine coinops-web x11-server

# Check logs
journalctl -u sunshine -f
journalctl -u coinops-web -f

# Verify ports
ss -tulpn | grep -E "(47984|8080)"
```

**Hardware acceleration issues:**
```bash
# Check VAAPI
vainfo

# Check NVIDIA
nvidia-smi

# Check Intel graphics
lspci | grep -i "intel.*graphics"
```

**Backup failures:**
```bash
# Check backup logs
tail -f /var/log/game-server/backup.log

# Verify directories
ls -la /opt/coinops/roms/
ls -la /data/backups/game-server/

# Test GPG encryption
gpg --list-keys
```

**Network connectivity:**
```bash
# Test Moonlight port
telnet localhost 47984

# Test web interface
curl http://localhost:8080

# Check firewall
ufw status
```

### Log Locations
- **Game Server Logs**: `/var/log/game-server/`
- **System Logs**: `journalctl -u game-server-*`
- **Backup Logs**: `/var/log/game-server/backup.log`
- **Monitoring Logs**: `/var/log/game-server/monitoring.log`

## Development and Customization

### Extending the Tools
The management scripts are designed to be modular and extensible:

1. **Add new monitoring checks** in `monitoring.sh`
2. **Customize backup retention** in `backup.sh`  
3. **Enhance web interface** by modifying `enhanced-web.js`
4. **Add new status checks** in `status.sh`
